Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
- It represents a little alien in her spaceship. She can do a lot of things, but many things can only be done when she is in her spaceship, among other things! In all, she can grab(...), drop(...), examine(...), use(...), walk(...), fly(...), shrink(), grow(), rest(), undo(), stopWalking(), disembark(), embark(), and wakeUp(). 
She can only interact with items if she has already grabbed them, and if it isn't broken. Items can break if they were dropped from a great height. She can only do those things if she is in her ship. 
She can only walk if she is not on her ship! 
Undoing brings her back to her original state.

- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
- I implemented stopWalking(), disembark(), embark(), and wakeUp().

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
- It took me a long time to consider what should and shouldn't be doable at certain points for the alien, and trying to keep things from crashing or slipping by was really difficult. I would map everything out next time before I start working. I would also seperate some of these methods into different classes.
